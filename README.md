# TIL by Mateusz FrÄ…k

I started to see benefits of noting down everything I learn every day. Creating my personal knowledge base saved me a lot of time looking up for solutions of the problems I've encountered in daily operations.

I've noticed I keep looking up for the same information over and over again, because I just can't remember everything. We are not the robots.

Sometimes I just need 30 minutes to forgot how to create CSR, how to add rule to iptables, and many more even though I did that just a moment ago! We are consuming too much information nowadays.

I wasted too much time of looking up for the same solution over and over again.

Now it's time to start sharing this knowledge to everyone.
